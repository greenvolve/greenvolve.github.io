Software is crucial for sustainability. Inefficient software
consumes more computational resources, leading to increased
energy usage and carbon emissions. As the digital infrastructure
scales globally, optimizing software performance becomes
essential not only for cost effectiveness but also for reducing
environmental impact, which advocates designing, maintaining,
and testing software systems that are energy-efficient,
resource-conscious, and environmentally sustainable.

As the software evolves, developers often make numerous
modifications to the software to address issues or implement
new features. However, modifications may unintentionally
degrade overall system performance and energy consumption,
leading to performance regression. Furthermore, current
testing practices are based on system-level evaluations
in controlled environments. However, these approaches often
struggle to keep up with rapid development cycles, such as
those in DevOps, due to their high demands for resources and
time.

Recent advances, such as improved cooling systems and the
shift from local computing to large-scale data centers, have
contributed to greater energy efficiency in software infrastructure.
However, the growing demand for machine learning
(ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), together with emerging
computing technologies, such as quantum computing (QC),
may offset these gains with their significant carbon footprint.
Despite these challenges, AI and QC also have significant
potential to promote sustainability through applications that
optimize resource usage and support environmental monitoring.

Therefore, we propose the Greenvolve workshop
with the following goals:

- **Discussing Opportunities for Green Software Engineering**.
Investigate how sustainability can be a part of
software design, architecture, maintenance, and evolution,
with a focus on energy efficiency and resource awareness.
- **Addressing Practical and Technical Challenges**.
Discuss how to integrate sustainability metrics into existing
development and DevOps workflows, especially in fast-paced
environments and modern architectures.
- **Fostering Collaboration**.
Encourage dialogue and cooperation among researchers and
practitioners in the fields of software engineering, AI,
quantum computing, and sustainability to share insights,
tools, and best practices.
- **Shaping the Future of Green Software Evolution**.
Identify open research questions, emerging trends, and future
directions in green software, including the role of AI
and quantum technologies in reducing the environmental
impact of digital infrastructure.

##### Topics include, but are not limited to
- Green software design, architecture, maintenance, and evolution
- Green performance testing and regression detection
- Metrics and modeling for green software
- Automation and tooling for green software
- Benchmarks for performance and sustainability

##### Submission
The workshop welcomes submission of three types of contributions:
- **Full papers** (maximum 8 pages): papers describing mature
research results, industrial case studies, or empirical
findings related to workshop topics.
- **Short papers** (maximum 4 pages): papers presenting
promising ideas, tool descriptions, or initial results for
which a full evaluation is not yet available. These may
include early-stage research, novel approaches, or innovative
applications in practice.
- **Position papers** (maximum 2 pages) visionary papers
offering perspectives on the future of performance engineering
in the next 5 to 10 years. These papers may
address anticipated challenges or emerging trends or call
for specific research directions.

Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.

Submissions will undergo a full double-anonymous review process. To be compliant with the double-anonymous policy, submitted papers must adhere to the same rules as those of the Research track of SANER 2026, which can be found [here](https://conf.researchr.org/track/saner-2026/saner-2026-papers).

All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTEX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the compsoc or compsocconf option.
IEEE paper templates can be accessed from their [official location](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates).

Submitted papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship.

All submissions must be in English and must not exceed page limits, which include figures and references.

Contributions need to be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair to [SANER 2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2026).
